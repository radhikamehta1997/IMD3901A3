Overview

This game is meant to be a whack-a-mole style game. Due to the difficulty I had with this assignment, it is not fully functional and only features the physics component for this game. 


Challenges

The challenges I faced with this project included a vast lack of resources and practical documentation. As we have not learned a ton of javascript in this program, I do not have a solid enough background in this programming language to fully understand how to correctly apply various modules and techniques. I also feel that we did not learn enough AFrame during class time as we were mainly working on our term projects, so I truly struggled with this assignment.

Solutions/Successes

The way that I faced this issues involved me constantly needing to scope my idea for this assignment in order to make it doable with the resources, skillset, and documentation I had available to me, especially considering the demanding nature of this assignment. However, I still found that in the end I ran out of time in order to make a completed product.
